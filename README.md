# Alcommend
An iOS application that calculates the calories, alcohol consumption for your night out, and uses server side machine learning to propose drinks on your next time out! Developed at GoodNightHack in London.

The application should be ready to use out of the box, as it includes the keys to the parse application as well.
Server-side javascript code for the machine learning logic coming soon.

#### Documentation coming soon!
Meanwhile, if you have any questions, feel free to drop me an email at mschinis[at]gmail[dot]com
